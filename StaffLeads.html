						<h3>Biography</h3>

						<p>Chris received his B.S. in Electrical Engineering in the Circuits and Devices concentration
							from the University of Pittsburgh in 2015, as well as the Nanoscience and Engineering
							Certificate. Undergraduate work experience involved a Senior Design Project with Eaton and
							Undergraduate Research experience with Dr. Brian D’Urso’s Nanomaterials Research Group,
							being exposed to electronics design of a photodetector amplifier circuit for an optical trap
							and learning about growth and characterization of Graphene. Before joining the Ohodnicki
							Lab, Chris worked at Keystone Compliance, LLC and performed Electromagnetic Interference
							(EMI) tests for five years. Research interests include the Standardization of
							Electromagnetic Components and Material Measurements, Core Loss of Magnetic Components, and
							Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) and Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) of components and
							materials.</p>

						<h3>Biography</h3>

						<p>Dipika received her M.Sc. in Physics from IIT Kanpur, India in 2015 following B.Sc. with
							Honors in Physics from University of Burdwan in 2013. She obtained Ph.D. degree in
							Physics (Experimental) from S. N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, India in
							2021, as a recipient of prestigious national fellowship from CSIR, India. During her
							Ph.D., she has extensively studied structural, frequency dependent dielectric and
							magnetic properties of transition metal-based ferrites focusing on their application in
							Electromagnetic Interference Shielding/ Microwave Absorption. She also has an expertise
							in synthesizing various complex nanostructures of ferrites as well as multiferroics.
							Currently, she is a Postdoctoral Researcher in Ohodnicki lab, University of Pittsburgh.
							Here her research interests orient on microwave processing technology development,
							measurement and analysis of microwave properties of materials, mainly ferrites, and
							their high-frequency applications.</p>
